# EmployeeProfileGenerator

### User Story ðŸ‘¤
a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an webpage that displays a profile for each person.


-  By automating this process with a command-line application, you can save time and reduce the risk of mistakes.
- By using a standardized template for each employee summary, you can ensure that each summary is consistent and contains all the necessary information.
- It saves time and effort compared to manually creating the webpage, and helps ensure consistency and accuracy in the information presented. 

### What did I learn?

- Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

- Create new objects using constructor functions.

- Add methods to objects using prototypal inheritance.

- Explain polymorphism through method overloading.

- Implement Promise.all() to wait for multiple API calls.

- Learned how to implement the principles of Test Driven Development by using Jest

- Build applications using test-driven developmentâ€”writing tests before implementing functionality.

- Implement ES6 classes to create new instances of objects.

- Extend basic classes with additional functionality.

- Implement multiple classes with different purposes to practice the OOP paradigm.
